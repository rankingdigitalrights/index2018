# 2. Introduction


Companies that enable people to connect and communicate through the internet have transformed billions of lives across the globe. So much of this change is positive that internet access now considered essential to economic opportunity, education, and political participation.

Yet the information and communication technology (ICT) sector faces a crisis of confidence from all sides. As this report goes to press Facebook is under fire for how it allowed its data to be used by people whose goal was to [manipulate democratic elections](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/mark-zuckerberg-response-facebook-cambridge-analytica).  A major global travel company has had its [systems broken into](http://www.zdnet.com/article/orbitz-says-hacker-stole-customer-data/) and customer data stolen. A growing number of governments are [shutting down internet access](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/rising-internet-shutdowns-aimed-silencing-dissent-180128202743672.html) to entire regions for days on end to stop transmission of speech they do not like. Blanket, pervasive surveillance in many countries makes it dangerous for many activists and investigative journalists to work online.

The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, which surveys public trust in a range of institutions across the world, notes “a [significant drop in trust in platforms](https://www.edelman.com/trust-barometer), notably search engines and social media” The Internet Society warns that a decline of trust in networked technologies could [deter some people from connecting at all](https://future.internetsociety.org/introduction/executive-summary/), or cause them to engage with technologies much less than they would have otherwise.

Companies will not rebuild our trust without demonstrating – not just with words but with actions – that they are committed to protecting and respecting our rights. Humanity is in trouble if investors cannot expect a business to be profitable without causing harm to users or facilitating the violation of their human rights - by governments as well as by non-state actors ranging from Cambridge Analytica to the Islamic State.

If human rights are to be protected and respected around the world, the internet must be designed, operated, and governed in a way that reinforces the protection and exercise of human rights. That is not presently the case. But fixing this problem requires more than a general diagnosis. The Ranking Digital Rights 2018 Corporate Accountability Index offers detailed evidence as to exactly how the world’s most powerful internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies are failing to respect users’ rights: specifically our rights to freedom of expression and privacy.

The purpose of this report, however, is not just to critique, but to offer a detailed and constructive roadmap for what companies can do to better respect users’ freedom of expression and privacy.  In so doing we also offer a clear framework for policymakers, investors, and civil society to use in helping, pushing - and even requiring when necessary - companies to build a better internet through which everybody on the planet can exercise their rights, and take full advantage of everything that the technology has to offer.

The Index results also highlight the many ways that government policy and regulation can either help or hinder companies’ respect for users’ freedom of expression and privacy. There is a clear lack of policy cohesion and coherence in many countries and regions, making it more difficult for multinational companies to respect the rights of all users in a consistent manner. Other regimes actively violate international human rights standards: they demand private sector compliance with official censorship and surveillance efforts and often forbid companies from disclosing information about how they comply with such demands. Some jurisdictions make it impossible for companies to achieve high scores in the Index. Yet at the same time, we have identified specific ways that every single companies can improve its policies even in the absence of legal or regulatory change.

**How to read this report:** Chapters 3-7 focus on key findings from the 2018 Index data that highlight areas of improvement since the 2017 Index was published, as well as persistent concerns.  While the Index evaluates companies across 35 different indicators, these five chapters focus on areas that we believe are of greatest concern and relevance – particularly in light of events of the past year.  All of these chapters include a section with recommendations for how companies can improve their policies. Chapters 8 and 9 provide recommendations for how governments and investors can act upon the Index results. Chapter 10 contains individual “report cards” for all of the 22 companies evaluated in the Index, with specific findings and recommendations for each company. Chapters 1 and 11 provide context and explanation for how research was conducted and how results were scored.

**Find more details on the website:** Despite its length this report provides only highlights from the Index data.

**Beyond 2018:** As technology and geopolitics evolve, we will continue to re-evaluate and adapt our methodology. In the second half of 2018 we will begin a research and consultation process to determine what indicators may need to be added to address the need for corporate transparency around the deployment of algorithms and artificial intelligence, and how targeted advertising technologies affect users’ rights. As always, we will be reporting on our progress and inviting your feedback on our website at https://rankingdigitalrights.org
