The 2017 Index measures if and how companies disclose their commitments, policies, and practices that affect usersâ€™ freedom of expression and privacy across 35 indicators in three main categories: [Governance](http://google.com), [Freedom of Expression](), and [Privacy](). Each category contains indicators measuring company disclosure for that category; each indicator is comprised of a series of elements that measure company disclosure for that indicator.
