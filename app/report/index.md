# 1. 2018 Index Methodology

The 2017 Index measures if and how companies disclose their commitments, policies, and practices that affect users’ freedom of expression and privacy across 35 indicators in three main categories: [Governance](http://google.com), [Freedom of Expression](), and [Privacy](). Each category contains indicators measuring company disclosure for that category; each indicator is comprised of a series of elements that measure company disclosure for that indicator.

## 1.1. Index categories ## {#index-categories}

- **Governance (G)**: This category contains six indicators measuring company disclosure of commitments to freedom of expression and privacy principles along with measures taken to implement those commitments across the ompany’s global operations. 

- **Freedom of Expression (F)**: This category contains 11 indicators measuring company disclosure of policies that affect users’ freedomof expression.

- **Privacy (P)**: This category contains 18 indicators measuring company disclosure of policies and practices that affect users’ privacy rights.

## 1.2. Company types ## {#company-type}

While every company we examined has attributes that make it unique, for the purpose of research and scoring, we divided the 22 companies into two groups.

**Internet and mobile ecosystems:** These company types were evaluated together because Google is both an internet company and a mobile ecosystem company, and Apple also offers services such as iMessage and iCloud. We did not evaluate hardware attributes of devices, focusing our assessment on disclosures pertaining to the newest devices offered by those companies and their operating systems. The freedom of expression and privacy issues faced by mobile cloud data and operating systems overlap with the issues faced by traditional internet services. Additional elements relevant only to mobile ecosystems were added to some indicators. For each company we examined up to four services, as follows: 

- Apple (U.S.) — iOS mobile ecosystem, iMessage, iCloud

- Baidu (China) — Baidu Search, Baidu Cloud, Baidu PostBar

- Facebook (U.S.) — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger

- Mail.Ru (Russia) — VKontakte, Mail.Ru email, Mail.Ru Agent

- Microsoft (U.S.) — Bing, Outlook.com, Skype

- Facebook (U.S.) — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger

- Kakao (South Korea) — Daum Search, DaumMail, KakaoTalk

- Google (U.S.) — Search, Gmail, YouTube,Android mobile ecosystem

- Samsung (South Korea) — Samsungimplementation of Android

- Tencent (China) — QZone, QQ, WeChat
