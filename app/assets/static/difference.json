        "description": "Twitter’s overall score improved despite weakening its disclosure of policies affecting users’ privacy. The company made several improvements in the Governance category, including by clarifying its human rights due diligence practices (G4). Twitter’s freedom of expression score increased due to improved disclosure of its process for responding to government and private requests to remove content or restrict account restrictions (F5, F6). However, Twitter’s privacy score declined due to revisions to its privacy policy that made the company’s handling of user information less clear. In particular, the policy lacked clarity about the purposes for which the company tracks users on third-party websites and for how long it retains this information (P9). It also revealed it no longer respects “Do Not Track” signals from users telling the company not to track them across the web (P9). <a href='https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2018/companies/twitter/'>Read Twitter’s report card for more</a>.",
