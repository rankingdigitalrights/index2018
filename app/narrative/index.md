chapter-title: 1. Index Metodology
chapter-intro: '<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he 2017 Index measures if and how companies disclose their commitments, policies, and practices that affect users’ freedom of expression and privacy across 35 indicators in three main categories: <a href="">Governance,</a> <a href="">Freedom of Expression,</a> and <a href="">Privacy</a>. Each category contains indicators measuring company disclosure for that category; each indicator is comprised of a series of elements that measure company disclosure for that indicator.</p>'

    title: 1.2. Company Type
    content: '<p> While every company we examined has attributes that make it unique, for the purpose of research and scoring, we divided the 22 companies into two groups.</p> <p> <span class="bold">Internet and mobile ecosystems: </span> These company types were evaluated together because Google is both an internet company and a mobile ecosystem company, and Apple also offers services such as iMessage and iCloud. We did not evaluate hardware attributes of devices, focusing our assessment on disclosures pertaining to the newest devices offered by those companies and their operating systems. The freedom of expression and privacy issues faced by mobile cloud data and operating systems overlap with the issues faced by traditional internet services. Additional elements relevant only to mobile ecosystems were added to some indicators. For each company we examined up to four services, as follows: </p> <ul> <li><p>Apple (U.S.) — iOS mobile ecosystem, iMessage, iCloud</p></li> <li><p>Baidu (China) — Baidu Search, Baidu Cloud, Baidu PostBar</p></li> <li><p>Facebook (U.S.) — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger</p></li> <li><p>Mail.Ru (Russia) — VKontakte, Mail.Ru email, Mail.Ru Agent</p></li> <li><p>Microsoft (U.S.) — Bing, Outlook.com, Skype</p></li> <li><p>Facebook (U.S.) — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger</p></li> <li><p>Kakao (South Korea) — Daum Search, DaumMail, KakaoTalk</p></li> <li><p>Google (U.S.) — Search, Gmail, YouTube,Android mobile ecosystem</p></li> <li><p>Samsung (South Korea) — Samsungimplementation of Android</p></li> <li><p>Tencent (China) — QZone, QQ, WeChat</p></li> <li><p>Twitter (U.S.) — Twitter, Vine, Periscope</p></li> <li><p>Yahoo (U.S.) — Yahoo Mail, Flickr, Tumblr</p></li> <li><p>Yandex (Russia) — Yandex Mail, YandexSearch, Yandex Disk</p></li> </ul> <p><span class="bold">Telecommunications companies:</span> For these companies, we evaluated global group-level policies for relevant indicators, plus the home-country operating subsidiary’s pre-paid and post-paid mobile service, and fixed-line broadband service where offered, as follows:</p> <ul> <li><p>América Móvil (Mexico) — Telcel</p></li> <li><p>AT&T (U.S.) — AT&T Mobile, AT&T Broadband</p></li> <li><p>Axiata (Malaysia) — Celcom</p></li> <li><p>Bharti Airtel (India) — India Airtel Mobile, India Airtel Broadband</p></li> <li><p>Etisalat (UAE) — Etisalat UAE Mobile, Etisalat UAE Broadband</p></li> <li><p>MTN (South Africa) — MTN South Africa Mobile</p></li> <li><p>Ooredoo (Qatar) — Ooredoo Qatar Mobile, Ooredoo Qatar Broadband</p></li> <li><p>Orange (France) — Orange France Mobile, Orange France Broadband</p></li> <li><p>Telefónica (Spain) — Movistar Mobile, Movistar Broadband</p></li> <li><p>Vodafone (UK) — Vodafone UK Mobile, Vodafone UK Broadband</p></li> </ul>'

Companies should disclose clear evidence of: senior-level oversight over freedom of expression and privacy, and employee training and whistleblower programs addressing these issues; </p> <p class="quote">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

We also expect companies to publish data about the volume and nature of content and accounts they have removed or restricted for violations to their terms, and to disclose if they notify users when they have removed content, restricted a user’s account, or otherwise restricted access to content or a service. </p> <p> <span class="bold">Handling user information: </span> We expect companies to clearly disclose each type of user informationthey collect, share, for what purposes they collect and share it, how they collect this information, and for how long they retain it. Indicators also look forcompanies to offer users options to control what is collected and to obtain all of the information a company holds on them. </p> <p> <span class="bold">Handling of government and private requests:</span> We expect companies to clearly disclose how they respond to requests by governments and private entities to restrict content and user accounts and to hand over user information. We also expect companies to produce data about the types of requests they receive and the number of these requests with which they comply. Companies should notify users when their information has been requested. </p>'

    title: 1.4. Evaluation
    content: '<p> <span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he Index evaluates company disclosure of the overarching “parent,” or “group,” level as wellas well as those of selected services and/or local operating companies (depending on company structure). The evaluation includes an assessmentof disclosure for every element of each indicator, based on one of the following possible answers: “full disclosure,” “partial,” “no disclosure found,”“no,” or “N/A.” Scoring: Companies receive a cumulative score of their performance across all Index categories, and results show how companies performed by eachcategory and indicator. Scores for the Freedom of Expression and Privacy categories are calculated by averaging scores for each service. Scores for the Governance category indicators include parentand operating-level performance (depending oncompany type). </p> <p><span class="bold">Points:</span></p> <ul> <li><p>Full disclosure = 100</p></li> <li><p>Partial = 50</p></li> <li><p>No disclosure found = 0</p></li> <li><p>No = 0</p></li> <li><p>N/A excluded from the score and averages</p></li> </ul> <p>Research for the 2017 Index was conducted from September 1, 2016 through January 13, 2017. Newinformation published by companies after that date was not evaluated.
