analysis_text: "América Móvil ranked fifth out of the 10 telecommunications companies evaluated and 16th in the Index overall. Although Freedom House rates Mexico’s internet environment as <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/mexico\" target=\"_blank\">'Partly Free'</a> the company could improve its disclosure of a number of policies even if laws and regulations do not change. These include the company’s policies on net neutrality and network management (F9), and data retention (P6). There is no obstacle in Mexico to reporting data about the number of government and private requests the company receives to share user information (P11). Mexico’s telecommunications authority requires companies to report on the number of government requests for real-time location tracking or access to user metadata, but the company has not published this data. Notably, the company’s disclosure about its security oversight has improved since the 2015 Index, as its <a href=\"http://www.americamovil.com/sites/default/files/2016-09/AMX-IS-2015-ingles.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Sustainability Report</a> included more detail about its internal systems to monitor employee access to information (P13)."

key_recommendation_paragraph: "<strong>América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V.</strong> provides telecommunications services to Mexico and 35 countries in the Americas and Europe. It offers mobile and fixed-voice and data services for retail and business customers and is one of the largest operators globally."

key_recommendation_list:
  - <strong>Be transparent about policies affecting users’ freedom of expression.</strong> The company should disclose more about how it enforces its rules, when it blocks content, and how it responds to network shutdown demands from governments. 
  - <strong>Be transparent about external requests.</strong> The company should disclose data about the number of government and private requests it receives to remove content and accounts and to hand over user information.
  - <strong>Disclose more about security practices.</strong> The company should clearly communicate its handling of data breaches to users.

governance_text: "América Móvil scored below most of the 10 telecommunications evaluated in the Governance category, but ahead of Bharti Airtel, Etisalat, Axiata, and Ooredoo. The company continued to lack clear disclosure of its commitments to human rights at the governance level, including whether it conducts human rights impact assessments (G4) or if it engages with a range of stakeholders on freedom of expression and privacy issues (G5). However, it disclosed more than most of its peers about remedy mechanisms addressing freedom of expression and privacy related complaints (G6). In Mexico <a href=\"http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFTR_311017.pdf" target=\"_blank\">companies are legally required to provide users with a complaint mechanism</a>."

freedom_text: "América Móvil revealed little about its policies affecting freedom of expression, and less than Vodafone, AT&T, and Telefónica.<br /><br /><strong>Content and account restrictions:</strong> Like most of its peers, Telcel disclosed little about its rules and how they are enforced. The company disclosed some information about what content and activities it prohibits (F3), but disclosed no data about the number of accounts it restricted for breaching these rules (F4). The company also failed to disclose any information on whether it informs users when their content or accounts are restricted (F8). <br /><br /><strong>Content and account restriction requests:</strong> América Móvil was one of six telecommunications companies evaluated that offered no information about how it handles government or private requests to restrict content or accounts (F5-F7). There are no laws in Mexico preventing the company from being more transparent about how it handles such requests.<br /><br /><strong>Network management and shutdowns:</strong> Telcel lacked disclosure about its network management policies (F9) and its approach to handling network shutdown requests from governments (F10). Despite committing to net neutrality, Telcel <a href=\"https://www.telcel.com/mundo_telcel/quienes-somos/corporativo/redes-sociales\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> it offers zero rating for certain content on specific social networks and instant messaging services (F9). Like most of its peers, the company disclosed no information about how it responds to government demands to shut down networks (F10).<br /><br /><strong>Identity policy:</strong> Telcel’s pre-paid contract asked users to provide their identification, although it was not clear if this is mandatory. In practice, it may be possible for users to purchase a prepaid SIM card without providing identification, but the company failed to clarify this (F11)."

privacy_text: "América Móvil ranked fifth out of the 10 telecommunications companies evaluated in the Privacy category, ranking behind AT&T, Orange, and several other companies.<br /><br /><strong>Handling of user information:</strong> Telcel disclosed less about how it handles user information than AT&T, Vodafone UK, and Telefónica Spain, but more than most other telecommunications companies evaluated (P3-P8). It disclosed little about what types of user information it collects (P3), shares (P4), and its reasons for doing so (P5). Like most of its peers, Telcel disclosed nothing about how long it retains user information (P6), although no law prohibits the company from doing so. It disclosed little about options users have to control what information is collected, including for targeted advertising (P7).<br /><br /><strong>Requests for user information:</strong> Like most telecommunications companies, América Móvil provided almost no information about how it handles (P10), and failed to disclose whether it informs users when their information is requested (P12). The company did not publish any data about such requests (P11), despite being required by law to report the number of government requests for real-time location tracking or user metadata to the country’s telecommunications authority. <br /><br /><strong>Security:</strong> Telcel did not provide as much information about its security policies as Vodafone UK, AT&T, and Telefónica Spain, but was on par with Airtel India and Orange France (P13-P18). Telcel failed to disclose any information about how it addresses security vulnerabilities, including if it offers a bug bounty program for security researchers to submit vulnerabilities (P14). Like most companies in the Index, Telcel disclosed nothing about its policies for addressing data breaches (P15). Companies in Mexico are <a href=\"https://www.telcel.com/mundo_telcel/quienes-somos/corporativo/redes-sociales\" target=\"_blank\">legally required</a> to notify users only if the data breach “significantly affects” their rights, however the company does not disclose this information to users."
