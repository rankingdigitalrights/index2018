**Guidance:** This indicator is only applicable to telecommunications companies. It seeks disclosure about whether companies engage in practices that affect the flow of content through their networks. We expect companies to commit to avoid prioritization or degradation of content. If companies do engage in these actions, we expect them to publicly disclose this and to explain their purpose for doing so. Note that this indicator does not address blocking of content; that is addressed in indicator F3. This indicator does include company disclosure related to blocking of services, apps, or devices, which are considered a type of prioritization.

**Evaluation:** Researchers are instructed to select one of four possible answer categories. Only companies that meet the criteria for the first answer category, “The company discloses that it does not prioritize or degrade the delivery of content.” will receive full credit for this indicator. Other answer categories receive progressively less credit.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company explanation of network management or traffic management practices
