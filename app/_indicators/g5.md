**Guidance:** This indicator seeks evidence that company engages with its stakeholders, particularly those who face clear human rights risks in connection with their online activities.

Engaging with stakeholders, particularly those who operate in high-risk environments, can be sensitive. A company may not feel comfortable publicly disclosing specific details about which stakeholders it consults, where or when they meet, and what they discuss. While we encourage companies to provide details about non-sensitive stakeholder engagement, we seek, at minimum, public disclosure that a company engages with stakeholders who are or represent users whose rights to freedom of expression and privacy are at risk. One way the public knows a company participates in this type of engagement is through its involvement in a multi-stakeholder initiative that brings the company in touch with representatives from various stakeholder groups including human rights organizations and others who advocate for the rights of at-risk groups.

**Evaluation:** A company will only receive full credit for this indicator if it fulfills element A. A company will receive partial credit if it meets one or both of the elements under B.
