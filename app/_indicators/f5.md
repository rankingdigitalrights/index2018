**Guidance:** Indicator F3 examines company disclosure of restrictions on what users can post or do on a service, and indicator F4 looks at company disclosure of restrictions on a user’s ability to access a service. This indicator, F5, focuses on whether companies disclose that they notify users when they take these types of actions. We expect companies to disclose a commitment to notify users when they have removed content, restricted a user’s account, or otherwise restricted users’ abilities to access a service. This disclosure should be part of companies’ explanations of content and access restriction practices.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company Terms of Service, acceptable use policy, community standards, content guidelines, abusive behavior policy, or similar document that explains the rules users have to follow.
 - Company support, help center, or FAQ (e.g., questions around why is content removed, why is an account suspended, etc.)
 - Company human rights policy
