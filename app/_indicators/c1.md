**Guidance:** This indicator seeks evidence that the company and the people who lead the company have made public commitments about the importance of freedom of expression and privacy.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is evaluated in two parts. A company can only receive full credit for this indicator if it receives a “Yes” for part A and “executive-level comment” for part B. We expect to see company commitments that relate to both freedom of expression and privacy.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company human rights policy
 - A company’s listing of its executive leadership team to identify who the company defines to be executive-level (for element B1). Company organization chart, annual reports, or proxy statements may also identify who is part of the company’s executive leadership team.
 - Major media outlets
 - Recordings or transcripts from public conferences
 - Public responses, letters, or other communications with legislators or government agencies
 - Public communications with civil society organizations
 - Company blog posts (with author clearly listed)
