**Guidance:** We expect companies to give users the ability to view and obtain copies of their data that the company holds. Company disclosure should explain what data this record contains and what formats users can obtain it in.

Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.
