**Guidance:** This indicator seeks company disclosure that the company’s governance and internal management structures include consideration of freedom of expression and privacy. The decisions made by executives and managers of Internet and telecommunications companies significantly affect people’s ability to experience freedom of expression and privacy. We expect these decision-making processes, and the chain of responsibility within the company, to explicitly consider these human rights.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if they disclose information about how they consider these issues at the board, executive, and management levels. At the board level, this would be a committee. Below board-level, it can include a company unit or individual that reports to the executive or managerial level. The committee, program, team, officer, etc. should specifically identify freedom of expression and privacy in its description of responsibilities.
