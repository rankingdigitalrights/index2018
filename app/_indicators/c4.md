**Guidance:** This indicator examines whether companies disclose the existence of any human rights impact assessment (HRIA) process including freedom of expression and privacy (See definition and references in Appendix 1.)

Note that this indicator does not expect companies to publish detailed results of their human rights impact assessments, since a thorough assessment includes sensitive information. Rather, it expects that companies should disclose that they conduct HRIAs and provide information on what their HRIA process encompasses.

While this indicator uses the language of human rights impact assessments, companies may use different names for this review process. What companies call their process is less important than what the process encompasses and accomplishes. This indicator will include a review of Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and other assessment processes that contain characteristics or components listed in this indicator but are not necessarily called “human rights impact assessments.”

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if they demonstrate that their assessment process addresses all elements in the checklist. If a company conducts HRIAs, but there is no public disclosure of the fact that it does so, the company will not receive credit.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company CSR/sustainability reports
 - Company human rights policy
 - Regulatory documents (e.g., U.S. Federal Trade Commission)
 - Reports from third-party assessors or accreditors
 - Global Network Initiative assessment reports
