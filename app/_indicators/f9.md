**Guidance:** Companies may employ staff to review content and/or user activity or they may rely on community flagging mechanisms through which other users flag content and/or activity for company review. This indicator seeks company disclosure of data on the number of instances a company has removed content or restricted users’ access due to violations of the company’s terms of service. Publicizing this data will provide the public with a more accurate view of the content removal ecosystem as well as companies’ own role in content removal. We expect companies to regularly publish data about their own decisions to remove content.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.
