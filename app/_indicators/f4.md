**Guidance:** Indicator F3 examines company disclosure of restrictions on what users can post or do on a service, while this indicator looks at company disclosure of restrictions on a user’s ability to access a service. Companies can restrict access to a service by deleting a user’s account or by shutting down a service entirely. We expect companies to explain to their users the circumstances under which they might take such action.

Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist. Element 2 is only applicable to telecommunications companies; Internet companies will receive a N/A (non-applicable) score for element 2. Internet companies must fulfill elements 1 and 3 to receive full credit for this indicator.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company Terms of Service, user contract, acceptable use policy, community standards, content guidelines, abusive behavior policy, or similar document that explains the rules users have to follow.
 - Company support, help center, or FAQ (e.g., questions around why is content removed, why is an account suspended, etc)
