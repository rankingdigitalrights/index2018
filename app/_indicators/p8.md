**Guidance:** We expect companies to disclose what user information they collect from third parties. This helps users understand how their activities outside the service can affect their use of the service.

**Evaluation:** If a company’s disclosure states that it does not collect any user information from third parties, fulfilling element A, the company receives full credit for the indicator. If a company does not fulfill element A, the researcher will look for company disclosure to meet the checklist elements of B. A company can only receive partial credit if its disclosure meets all elements in the B checklist.
