**Guidance:** We expect companies to proactively provide users with options to control what user information the company collects and shares. Users should be able to access these options after they sign up for the service, not simply at the time of sign-up. Simply signing up for the service does not represent consent.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist. We expect companies to disclose what the options to control are, rather than simply disclose that the users have options.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company privacy policy
 - Company account settings
