**Guidance:** We expect companies to disclose a commitment to notify users, when legally possible, in cases where third parties request data about users. We acknowledge that this notice may not be possible in legitimate cases of an ongoing investigation, however, companies should explain this to users.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.
