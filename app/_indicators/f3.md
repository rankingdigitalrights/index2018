**Guidance:** Companies often set boundaries for what content users can post on a service as well as what activities users can engage in on the service. We expect companies to disclose to their users what these rules are and how companies enforce them. This includes legal requirements to block certain types of content as well as restrictions related to intellectual property (e.g., copyright infringement). In this disclosure, the company should also provide examples to help users understand what these rules mean.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company Terms of Service, user contract, acceptable use policy, community standards, content guidelines, abusive behavior policy, or similar document that explains the rules users have to follow.
 - Company support, help center, or FAQ (e.g., questions around why is content removed, why is an account suspended, etc)
