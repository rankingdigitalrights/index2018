**Guidance:** Companies increasingly receive requests to remove, filter, or restrict access to content. They also receive requests to restrict access to users or, in rare cases, shut down a network. These requests can come from governments agencies, courts, or private parties. We expect companies to publicly disclose their process explaining how they respond to requests from each type of third party.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.
