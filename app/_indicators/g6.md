**Guidance:** This indicator examines whether companies provide remedy mechanisms and whether they have a publicly disclosed process for responding to complaints or grievance reports from individuals who believe that the company has violated or directly facilitated violation of their freedom of expression or privacy rights.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if they demonstrate that their remedy and grievance mechanisms include all elements in the checklist.

**Potential sources:**

 - Company terms of service or equivalent user agreements
 - Company content policies
 - Company privacy policies, privacy guidelines, or privacy resource site
 - Company CSR/sustainability report
 - Company help center or user guide
 - Company transparency report (for the number of complaints received)
