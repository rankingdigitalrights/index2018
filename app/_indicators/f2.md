**Guidance:** It is common for companies to change their terms of service as their business evolves. We expect companies to commit to notify users when they change these terms and to provide users with information to understand what these changes mean. This indicator seeks company disclosure on the method and timeframe within which companies commit to notify users about changes in the terms of service. It also seeks evidence that a company provides publicly available records of previous terms so that people can understand how the companyâ€™s terms have evolved over time.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.
