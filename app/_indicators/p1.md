**Guidance:** Privacy policies address how companies collect, manage, use, and secure information about users as well as information provided by users. We expect companies to provide these policies freely and to make an effort to help users understand what they mean.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist. Terms of Service are NOT included in this indicator since they are covered in separate indicators in the “Freedom of Expression” section.

**Potential sources:**
