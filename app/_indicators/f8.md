research: Indicator F3 examines company disclosure of restrictions on what users can post or do on a service. This indicator, F8, focuses on whether companies clearly disclose that they notify users when they take these types of actions (whether due to terms of service enforcement or third-party restriction requests). A company’s decision to restrict or remove access to content or accounts can have a significant impact on users’ freedom of expression and access to information rights. We therefore expect companies to disclose that they notify users when they have removed content, restricted a user’s account, or otherwise restricted users’ abilities to access a service. If a company removes content that a user has posted, we expect the company to inform that user about its decision. If a different user attempts to access content that the company has restricted, we expect the company to notify that user about the content restriction. We also expect companies to specify reasons for their decisions. This disclosure should be part of companies’ explanations of their content and access restriction practices.</p><p><b>Potential sources:</b></p><ul><li>Company terms of service, acceptable use policy, community standards, content guidelines, abusive behavior policy, or similar document that explains the rules users have to follow.</li><li>Company support page, help center, or FAQ (e.g., questions around why is content removed, why is an account suspended, etc.)</li><li>Company guidelines for developers</li><li>Company human rights policy</li></ul>
