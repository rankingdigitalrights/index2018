**Guidance:** This indicator examines company disclosure of data on the requests it receives from governments to remove content. Publicizing this data helps the public gain a greater understanding of how freedom of expression operates online, and it helps the public hold companies and governments accountable for their respective roles to respect and protect freedom of expression. For these reasons, we expect companies to regularly publish data about the government requests they receive to remove content.

In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s elements. For example, we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws sometimes prevent companies from doing so, and researchers will document situations where this is the case. But a company will lose points if it fails to meet all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to be uncompetitive, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.

**Evaluation:** This indicator is scored using a checklist, meaning companies can only receive full credit if their disclosure meets all elements in the checklist.
